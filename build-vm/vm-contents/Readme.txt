This tool is developed and maintained by Dr. Nikolaos Tsantalis and his team. I just created a virtual machine as part of my class project.

JDeodorant is an Eclipse plug-in that identifies design problems in software, known as bad smells, and resolves them by applying appropriate refactorings.

JDeodorant employs a variety of novel methods and techniques in order to identify code smells and suggest the appropriate refactorings that resolve them.
